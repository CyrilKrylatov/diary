title: Composition with styled-components or emotion

When I use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) or [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), it often happens that I want to extend more than only one component to another one. But I don't only want to extend, I also want to extend in certain situations directly via props. So I read lots of issues on [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)' github page and I finally found a solution which I find great.

Imagine this:

```javascript
// MyElement.js
const MyElement = styled.div``
```

Alright, you want know to extend it.

```javascript
// Base.js
const Base = styled.div``

// MyElement.js
const MyElement = styled(Base)``
```

Lovely.

But now, you want to extend it by another one again. Ha! Tough right?

The idea is to do that:

```javascript
// base.js
const base = css``

// anotherBase.js
const anotherBase = css``

// MyElement.js
const MyElement = styled.div`
  ${base}
  ${anotherBase}
`
```

Boom! ðŸ’¥

Bonus: you could use it depending on certains props like:

```javascript
// base.js
const base = css``

// anotherBase.js
const anotherBase = css``

// MyElement.js
const MyElement = styled.div`
  ${base}

  ${({ active }) =>
    active &&
    css`
      ${anotherBase}
    `}
`
```

That's great, right?!

If you have any other idea to extend it in a better way, feel free to [contact me on Twitter](http://twitter.kud.io). Thanks! Bye bye!
