title: How to use bck-i-search in your shell

There's a command I often use in my shell calling `bck-i-search`. It allows you to search in your history a command already executed in your shell.

You've got two ways:

- `bck-i-search` for back
- `fwd-i-search` for forth

Just use `ctrl+r` in your terminal and you'll open `bck-i-search`. Type a word and the command will find you one line. If you want to go deeper in history, use again `ctrl-r` and if you want to use the forth way, use `ctrl-s`.
